        <h2>Methodology</h2>

        <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
        <p>
            The system fetches real-time train location data from the GTFS-RT (General Transit Feed Specification -
            Real-time)
            API using the API key for the Caltrain operator. The data collected includes each trainâ€™s ID, its latitude
            and longitude,
            stop ID, and the timestamp of when the location was recorded. Collected data from <span
                id="start_date"></span> to <span id="stop_date"></span> with <span id="n_datapoints"></span> data
            points.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Storing Data</h3>
        <p>
            The data is stored in an SQLite database (<code>caltrain_lat_long.db</code>). A table called
            <code>train_locations</code>
            is used to store the information if it doesn't already exist. Each record is uniquely identified by the
            combination of
            timestamp, trip ID, and stop ID to prevent duplicate entries.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Data Processing</h3>
        <p>
            The stored data is processed by joining it with additional static data from the GTFS (schedules and stops).
            The system
            calculates the distance between a train's current position and the scheduled stop using the Haversine
            formula to detect
            when a train has arrived at a stop.
        </p>

        <h3>4. On-Time Performance Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            The on-time performance is calculated by comparing the actual arrival time (when the train is closest to the
            stop)
            with the scheduled arrival time. The delay for each trip is computed in minutes, and a trip is flagged as
            "delayed"
            if it arrives more than 4 minutes late.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Performance Metrics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Overall on-time performance:</b> The percentage of trains arriving on time is calculated.</li>
            <li><b>Best/worst performing trains and stops:</b> Trains and stops with the shortest and longest average
                delays are identified.</li>
            <li><b>Delay severity:</b> Trips are classified as "Minor" (4-15 minutes late) or "Major" (more than 15
                minutes late).</li>
            <li><b>Commute periods:</b> Delays are analyzed separately for morning (6-9 AM) and evening (3:30-7:30 PM)
                commute times.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Visualizations</h3>
        <p>
            Plotly is used to generate graphs for various metrics such as daily on-time performance, delay severity,
            and delays during morning/evening commute times. These graphs are saved as HTML files and displayed in a
            website using iframes.
